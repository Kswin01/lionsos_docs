# Components

With LionsOS, there is no 'default' configuration or system. It is entirely up to the
users of LionsOS to decide what components they want in their system and what policies
they want those components to follow.

What LionsOS provides is the standard components and libraries that are generic to
any system, such as device drivers.

This section discusses the components provided by LionsOS.
