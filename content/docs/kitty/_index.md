# An example LionsOS system

Since LionsOS is trying to be a fundamentally different operating system, we need to teach people how to properly use it.

The purpose of the example system is to show off a real deployable
system using all or almost all of the components of LionsOS.

The system we have built is called the Kitty, it is a Point-of-Sale (PoS)
system intended to be used for buying snacks in the Trustworthy Systems
Lab.
