# Reference system

Since LionsOS is trying to be a fundamentally different operating system,
we need to teach people how to properly use it.

The purpose of this reference system is to show off a real, deployable
system using all of the components that LionsOS provides.

The system we have built is called the Kitty, it is a Point-of-Sale (PoS)
system intended to be used for buying snacks in the Trustworthy Systems
Lab.

## Architecture

Below is a diagram of the (simplified) architecutre of the Kitty system that contains
all of the various components involved.
