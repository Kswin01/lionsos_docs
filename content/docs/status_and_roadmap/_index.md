# Project status & Roadmap

The first release version is now live.  It has a number of known
issues (see the Github issue trackers in the relevant repositories)
but is working for the Kitty and VMM examples.

Planned changes over the next three months are:
 1. Improve the build system, so the Kitty example uses the same
    techniques as the VMM example
 2. Add documentation to this website
 3. Add a webserver example base on the same code as the Kitty.
